## Russian model for Kaldi

Copyright 2017-2020 AC Technologies LLC

This is a Kaldi model for Russian

Before testing adjust Kaldi root location in decoding script.

Run decode.sh to test the decoding with a wav file, make sure that file is 8khz mono PCM format.

Requires more or less recent Kaldi version, earlier versions will not work

## Changes in version 0.7

Bigger tdnn-f model with specaugment, more epochs
Much better language model trained on huge amount of texts

## Changes in version 0.8

More data and augmentations, should be better on phone calls

## Changes in version 0.9

Added RNNLM rescoring

## Changes in version 0.10

No accuracy changes, reorganize layout to directly load the model from vosk-api

## WER estimates

| Model                                    |  v0.6 WER  |  v0.7 WER  |  v0.8 WER  | v0.9/v0.10 WER  |

Note that for the best accuracy you need to use RNNLM rescoring which is
not yet supported in vosk-api, you have to use decoding script from the
archive. But vosk-api should be ok too, it supports carpa rescoring and
should be close to RNNLM.

The openstt results use fixed references (attached in extra/openstt-ref folder)
